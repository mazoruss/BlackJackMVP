# BlackJackMVP
Simple Black Jack game from scratch

The final goal is a black jack app that teaches people how to count cards.
The path can be divided into multiple smaller sections.
Priorities:
	1. get the game to work: Player, Dealer, Rounds, Shuffle
	2. have a betting system: the amount is automated added/deducted 
	3. have a log in system: each user has a certain amount of credit stored in DB
	4. have instructions on how card counting works
	5. show percentages depending on state of the deck
	6. incorporate multi-deck, multi-player, and more advanced strategies (probably not happening)
